## StringsGenerator

StringsGenerator was written by [@gardenpunk](https://github.com/lennyferguson) to help generate spacing strings based on the currently existing glyphs in a given font. StringsGenerator uses color coding of glyphs to generate spacing strings based on three classes:
* Uppercase
* Lowercase
* Numbers
